## Description
- This project tackled a real-world challenge by automating the manual exam seating arrangement process at my undergraduate institute, SGSITS, Indore.  
- Developed an automated exam seating system that replaced manual processes, reducing preparation time by 80% and saving approximately 40 work hours per exam cycle.  
- Addressed key challenges such as overlapping courses, room capacities, and seat allocations, ensuring fair distribution and compliance with examination policies. Implemented robust data input validation and error-handling mechanisms, eliminating inconsistencies.  
- Currently in active use at SGSITS, Indore.
