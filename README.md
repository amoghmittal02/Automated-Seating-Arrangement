## Description
- This project addressed a real-world problem by automating the manual exam seating arrangement process at my undergraduate institute, SGSITS, Indore

approximately 40 work hours per exam cycle.
- Addressed challenges related to overlapping courses, room capacities, and seat allocations, ensuring equitable seat distribution
and compliance with examination policies as well as data input and validation, developing error-handling mechanisms that
reduced input inconsistencies by 30%.
